Matchismo Playing Card Game of cs193p lecture (Winter 2013)

We start by just showing a 'playing card' (it's just a button).
On one side is the apple logo.
And on the other is a card: like "Ace of Clubs"
As we click the 'card', it should flip the card and on faceUp show us a random card from a 52 card deck.

This project will be expanded on to actually show cards. And then do matches with scoring. A matching game based on playing cards.

* the initial assignment was to integrate the model into the controller.
** that is: PlayingCardDeck (and PlayingCard, Card)
** this should show one of the 52 cards on each flip until you run out of cards.
*** note currently there is no game over. it just shows "?" on 53 and up.

now we have a card matching game, 2-3 cards. +game results.
